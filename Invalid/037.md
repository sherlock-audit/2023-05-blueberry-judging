# [M] getPrice() does not account for the possibility of the sequencer being down

## Summary
A bug has been identified in the getPrice function of the ChainlinkAdapterOracle contract where it fails to handle a situation when the Chainlink sequencer is down.

## Vulnerability Detail
The getPrice function in the ChainlinkAdapterOracle contract does not account for the situation where the Chainlink sequencer might be down. In such a case, the function would still attempt to get the latest round data, which could lead to inaccurate or non-existent price data.

## Impact
The absence of a check for the status of the Chainlink sequencer can lead to failures of the getPrice function and this could potentially result in transactions based on incorrect price data, impacting any mechanisms that rely on this price information.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to include a check for the status of the Chainlink sequencer within the getPrice function. If the sequencer is down, the function should return an error.

Implement a check for the sequencer's status like this : 

```solidity


      (
            /*uint80 roundID*/,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt,
            /*uint256 updatedAt*/,
            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        ) = sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();

        // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
        // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }

```
