# BlueBerryBank.sol: Incorrect  liquidation logic would be implemented in some cases

## Summary

The implementation of `BlueBerryBank.liquidate()` is wrong in a few cases, which could lead to the liquidator getting all collaterals and underlying token shares by paying only one debt token.

## Vulnerability Detail

Note that when a position is liquidatable, anybody can call `BlueBerryBank.liquidate()` and get some collaterals and underlying token shares stored in a vault after paying some debt. The liquidator pays only one debt token at a time.

If the liquidator pays full debt of a debtToken, the share will be same as oldShare.

```solidity
        uint256 oldShare = pos.debtShare;
        (uint256 amountPaid, uint256 share) = _repay(
            positionId,
            debtToken,
            amountCall
        );
```

Because when the liquidator pays oldDebt in `_repay()`, `lessShare` will be same as `oldShare`.

```solidity
function _repay(
        uint256 positionId,
        address token,
        uint256 amountCall
    ) internal returns (uint256, uint256) {
        Bank storage bank = banks[token];
        Position storage pos = positions[positionId];
        if (pos.debtToken != token) revert Errors.INCORRECT_DEBT(token);
        uint256 totalShare = bank.totalShare;
        uint256 totalDebt = _borrowBalanceStored(token);
        uint256 oldShare = pos.debtShare;
        uint256 oldDebt = (oldShare * totalDebt).divCeil(totalShare);
        if (amountCall > oldDebt) {
            amountCall = oldDebt;
        }
        amountCall = _doERC20TransferIn(token, amountCall);
        uint256 paid = _doRepay(token, amountCall);
        if (paid > oldDebt) revert Errors.REPAY_EXCEEDS_DEBT(paid, oldDebt); // prevent share overflow attack
        uint256 lessShare = paid == oldDebt
            ? oldShare
            : (paid * totalShare) / totalDebt;
        bank.totalShare -= lessShare;
        pos.debtShare -= lessShare;
        return (paid, lessShare);
    }
```

Let us get back to `BlueBerryBank.liquidate()`. If `share = oldShare,` `liqSize = pos.collateralSize`, and all of collateral amounts will be sent to the liquidator. And pos.collateralSize will be 0, and similar things happen to uVaultShare.

```solidity
        uint256 liqSize = (pos.collateralSize * share) / oldShare;
        uint256 uVaultShare = (pos.underlyingVaultShare * share) / oldShare;

        pos.collateralSize -= liqSize;
        pos.underlyingVaultShare -= uVaultShare;

        // Transfer position (Wrapped LP Tokens) to liquidator
        IERC1155Upgradeable(pos.collToken).safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            msg.sender,
            pos.collId,
            liqSize,
            ""
        );
```

The liquidator paid only one debt, but he will get all of collateral and underlying shares stored in vault. The collateral and underlying supports all debt tokens, not only one debt token, so this implementation is not correct.

## Impact

The liquidator gets more than he should get, so it will cause fund loss of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use something like:

```solidity
liqSize = (pos.collateralSize * share) * (debt of debtToken) / oldShare / (total debt)
```

instead of:

```solidity
liqSize = (pos.collateralSize * share) / oldShare.
```

And same things to uVaultShare.
