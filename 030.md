# ShortLongSpell#openPosition attempts to burn wrong token

## Summary

ShortLongSpell#openPosition attempts to burn vault.uToken when it should be using vault instead. The result is that ShortLongSpell#openPosition will be completely nonfunctional when the user is adding to their position

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/ShortLongSpell.sol#L133-L140

            address burnToken = address(ISoftVault(strategy.vault).uToken());
            if (collSize > 0) {
                if (posCollToken != address(wrapper))
                    revert Errors.INCORRECT_COLTOKEN(posCollToken);
                bank.takeCollateral(collSize);
                wrapper.burn(burnToken, collSize);
                _doRefund(burnToken);
            }

We see above that the contract attempts to withdraw vault.uToken from the wrapper.

        _doPutCollateral(
            vault,
            IERC20Upgradeable(ISoftVault(vault).uToken()).balanceOf(
                address(this)
            )
        );

This is in direct conflict with the collateral that is actually deposited which is vault. This will cause the function to always revert when adding to an existing position.

## Impact

ShortLongSpell#openPosition will be completely nonfunctional when the user is adding to their position
