# Invalid Curve LP price calculation

## Summary

The Curve LP price is calculated not fully correct

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently, the price is calculated as pool.get_virtual_price() * min(underlying_token_prices). This is not fully correct because tokens may be valued differently (recent example of USDC depeg shows that). Even if second big stable depeg may be considered not very likely scenario, there is often occur situations, when stable may be trading on 1.01. Also, in case of using curve pools with less known stables, depeg likelyhood is higher.

## Impact

If the LP token is priced incorrectly, users may be able to open undercollaterized positions, which may be critical for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change formula to sum(token_i * price_token_i) / pool_lp.totalSupply()
