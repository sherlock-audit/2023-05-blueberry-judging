# In the AuraSpell protocol, users are unable to open a position.

## Summary
The AuraSpell protocol only allows the vault to spend its own borrow token, so joining the pool will fail, as token.safeTransferFrom() in valut will revert

## Vulnerability Detail
The `AuraSpell.openPositionFarm()` is used to open a new position in a Balancer pool. Inside the function, the protocol will  compute the maximum amounts of tokens that can be added to the Balancer pool, based on the current balances of the pool tokens. It then calculates the expected amount of BPT tokens that will be received in return for adding liquidity to the pool, using the joinPool function of the Balancer vault. However ,the protocol only allows the vault to spend its own borrow token, so the vault protocol will fail when calling token.safeTransferFrom(), preventing the user from joining the vault..
```solidity
 _ensureApprove(param.borrowToken, address(vault), borrowBalance);

            (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory balances, ) = wAuraPools
                .getPoolTokens(lpToken);
            uint[] memory maxAmountsIn = new uint[](2);
            maxAmountsIn[0] = IERC20(tokens[0]).balanceOf(address(this));
            maxAmountsIn[1] = IERC20(tokens[1]).balanceOf(address(this));

            uint totalLPSupply = IBalancerPool(lpToken).totalSupply();
            // compute in reverse order of how Balancer's `joinPool` computes tokenAmountIn
            uint poolAmountFromA = (maxAmountsIn[0] * totalLPSupply) /
                balances[0];
            uint poolAmountFromB = (maxAmountsIn[1] * totalLPSupply) /
                balances[1];
            uint poolAmountOut = poolAmountFromA > poolAmountFromB
                ? poolAmountFromB
                : poolAmountFromA;

            bytes32 poolId = bytes32(param.farmingPoolId);
            if (poolAmountOut > 0) {
                vault.joinPool(
                    poolId,
                    address(this),
                    address(this),
                    IBalancerVault.JoinPoolRequest(
                        tokens,
                        maxAmountsIn,
                        "",
                        false
                    )
                );
            }
        }
```

## Impact
The protocol will not be able to join the Balancer pool
