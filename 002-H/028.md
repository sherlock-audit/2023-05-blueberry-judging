# BalancerPairOracle will return highly incorrect price if one token isn't 18 dp

## Summary

When calculating the fair reserves of the balancer LP, the contract makes the mistake of passing in 18 dp prices but leaving balances in the native decimals of the tokens. This will skew the fair reserves heavily towards one token if it is not 18 dp. The result is that the oracle will return a price that off by a huge amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary.

## Impact

Oracle is unreliable and dangerous if either token isn't 18 dp

## Recommendation

Adjust the reserves to 18 dp before passing into computeFairReserves.
