# AuraSpell.closePositionFarm forces uses to exit Balancer pools w/ no slippage protection

## Summary
Submitting this because although it is similar to some valid findings from the previous audit, this specific instance has not been mentioned. 

I would like to mention that the Issue I am referring to is seperate from the one found here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-blueberry-judging/issues/121. 

## Vulnerability Detail
AuraSpell does not use slippage protection when exiting balancer pools. 

minAmountsOut are declared as a uint array with length two, making the default values for each index in the array 0. 
These values are never reassigned, meaning the minAmt out for each token will be 0. 

## Impact
on exits, user get sandwiched and rekt.

## Tool used

## Recommendation
Allow user to pass in slippage protection paramters.
