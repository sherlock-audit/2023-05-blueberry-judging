# If `pool.shutdown` in the convex.pool contract becomes true,users may lose their funds

## Summary
If `pool.shutdown` in the convex.pool contract becomes true, when calling `cvxPools.withdraw()` the cvxPools will not withdraw lp token and there may not be enough LP tokens to transfer to the protocol. In this case ,calling the `ConvexSpell.closePositionFarm()` may fail. When user's position is about to be liquidated, if the closePositionFarm() function is not available ,user may be unable to repay his debt, resulting in the user losing their funds


## Vulnerability Detail
The `ConvexSpell.closePositionFarm()` function is designed to close a farming position. Inside the function, the protocol will take out the collateral and call the ` wConvexPools.burn()` function to burn wrapped tokens, receiving CRV LP tokens and harvesting CRV rewards.It also withdraws isolated collateral from the bank and repays the borrowed amount.
```solidity
    function closePositionFarm(
        ClosePosParam calldata param,
        IUniswapV2Router02 swapRouter,
        address[][] calldata swapPath
    )
        external
        existingStrategy(param.strategyId)
        existingCollateral(param.strategyId, param.collToken)
    {
        address crvLp = strategies[param.strategyId].vault;
        IBank.Position memory pos = bank.getCurrentPositionInfo();
        if (pos.collToken != address(wConvexPools))
            revert Errors.INCORRECT_COLTOKEN(pos.collToken);
        if (wConvexPools.getUnderlyingToken(pos.collId) != crvLp)
            revert Errors.INCORRECT_UNDERLYING(crvLp);

        // 1. Take out collateral - Burn wrapped tokens, receive crv lp tokens and harvest CRV
        bank.takeCollateral(param.amountPosRemove);
        (address[] memory rewardTokens, ) = wConvexPools.burn(
            pos.collId,
            param.amountPosRemove
        );

```
```solidity
function burn(
        uint256 id,
        uint256 amount
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        returns (address[] memory rewardTokens, uint256[] memory rewards)
    {
        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            amount = balanceOf(msg.sender, id);
        }
        (uint256 pid, ) = decodeId(id);
        _burn(msg.sender, id, amount);

        (address lpToken, , , address crvRewarder, , ) = getPoolInfoFromPoolId(
            pid
        );
        // Claim Rewards
        IRewarder(crvRewarder).withdraw(amount, true);
        // Withdraw LP
        cvxPools.withdraw(pid, amount);
```

        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        address lptoken = pool.lptoken;
        address gauge = pool.gauge;

        //remove lp balance
        address token = pool.token;
        ITokenMinter(token).burn(_from,_amount);

        //pull from gauge if not shutdown
        // if shutdown tokens will be in this contract
        if (!pool.shutdown) {
            IStaker(staker).withdraw(lptoken,gauge, _amount);
        }
```
