# Stuckage of LP tokens is still possible which would mean that they are not sent back to withdrawing user from the IchiSpell contract


## Summary

When users withdraw their assets from `IchiSpell.sol,` the function unwinds their position and sends them back their assets, but it never sends them back the amount they requested to withdraw, leaving the tokens stuck in the Spell contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user withdraws from IchiVaultSpell.sol, they either call `closePosition()` or `closePositionFarm()`, both of which make an internal call to `_withdraw()`.

Now take a look at the internal [_withdraw()] function

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Internal function to withdraw assets from ICHI Vault
     * @dev Withdraw assets from ICHI Vault,
     *      Swap withdrawn assets to debt token,
     *      Withdraw isolated collaterals from Blueberry Money Market,
     *      Repay Debt and refund rest to user
     */
    function _withdraw(ClosePosParam calldata param) internal {
        if (param.sellSlippage > bank.config().maxSlippageOfClose())
            revert Errors.RATIO_TOO_HIGH(param.sellSlippage);

        Strategy memory strategy = strategies[param.strategyId];
        IICHIVault vault = IICHIVault(strategy.vault);

        // 1. Compute repay amount if MAX_INT is supplied (max debt)
        uint256 amountRepay = param.amountRepay;
        if (amountRepay == type(uint256).max) {
            amountRepay = bank.currentPositionDebt(bank.POSITION_ID());
        }

        // 2. Calculate actual amount to remove
        uint256 amountPosRemove = param.amountPosRemove;
        if (amountPosRemove == type(uint256).max) {
            amountPosRemove = vault.balanceOf(address(this));
        }

        // 3. Withdraw liquidity from ICHI vault
        vault.withdraw(amountPosRemove, address(this));

        // 4. Swap withdrawn tokens to debt token
        bool isTokenA = vault.token0() == param.borrowToken;
        uint256 amountToSwap = IERC20Upgradeable(
            isTokenA ? vault.token1() : vault.token0()
        ).balanceOf(address(this));

        if (amountToSwap > 0) {
            SWAP_POOL = IUniswapV3Pool(vault.pool());
            uint160 deltaSqrt = (param.sqrtRatioLimit *
                uint160(param.sellSlippage)) / uint160(Constants.DENOMINATOR);
            SWAP_POOL.swap(
                address(this),
                // if withdraw token is Token0, then swap token1 -> token0 (false)
                !isTokenA,
                amountToSwap.toInt256(),
                isTokenA
                    ? param.sqrtRatioLimit + deltaSqrt
                    : param.sqrtRatioLimit - deltaSqrt, // slippaged price cap
                abi.encode(address(this))
            );
        }

        // 5. Withdraw isolated collateral from Bank
        _doWithdraw(param.collToken, param.amountShareWithdraw);

        // 6. Repay
        _doRepay(param.borrowToken, amountRepay);

        _validateMaxLTV(param.strategyId);

        // 7. Refund
        _doRefund(param.borrowToken);
        _doRefund(param.collToken);
    }
```

Different arguments are passed into the function via the `param`

In order to accomplish these goals, the contract does the following...

1. Removes the LP tokens from the ERC1155 holding them for collateral.

2. Calculates the number of LP tokens to withdraw from the vault.

3. Converts the non-borrowed token that was withdrawn in the borrowed token .

4. Withdraw the underlying token from Compound.

5. Pay back the borrowed token to Compound.

6. Validate that this situation does not put us above the maxLTV for our loans.

7. Sends the remaining borrow token that weren't paid back and withdrawn underlying tokens to the user.
   doRefund(borrowToken);
   doRefund(collToken);

Most importantly, the step of sending the remaining LP tokens to the user is skipped, even though the function specifically does the calculations to ensure that aamountPosRemove is held back from being taken out of the vault.

## Impact

Users who close their positions and choose to keep LP tokens (rather than unwinding the position for the constituent tokens) will have their LP tokens stuck permanently in the IchiSpell contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an additional line to the `_withdraw()` function to refund all LP tokens as well:

```solidity
  doRefund(borrowToken);
  doRefund(collToken);
+ doRefund(address(vault));
```
