# Users will get less rewards than expected when burning ERC1155 tokens to redeem LP ERC20 tokens back in WIchiFarm#burn

## Summary
Users may receive less than the expected rewards due to rounding issues in `pendingRewards`.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user interacts with [WIchiFarm.burn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-blueberry/blob/ec27daf841c4e89445af2559a4cc7b1f09ee2858/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WIchiFarm.sol#L162) to burn and redeem some `LP ERC20` token back, amongst many things, this function makes a call to [pendingRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-blueberry/blob/ec27daf841c4e89445af2559a4cc7b1f09ee2858/blueberry-core/contracts/wrapper/WIchiFarm.sol#L110) in order to get pending rewards from the farming pool. Here, the function calculates the users rewards:
```solidity
        uint256 stIchi = (stIchiPerShare * amount).divCeil(10 ** lpDecimals);
        uint256 enIchi = (enIchiPerShare * amount) / (10 ** lpDecimals);
        uint256 ichiRewards = enIchi > stIchi ? enIchi - stIchi : 0;
        // Convert rewards to ICHI(v2) => ICHI v1 decimal: 9, ICHI v2 Decimal: 18
        ichiRewards *= 1e9;
```
The problem here is, how the `stIchi` is calculated compared to `enIchi`, since by default solidity rounds down all floats, `stIchi` will be rounded up, due to the use of the `divCeil` and `enIchi` will be rounded down. Now, how does this affect users rewards?

Let's consider this simple example:

amount = 350,000 
stIchiPerShare = 220,000 
enIchiPerShare = 250,000  

using this:
```solidity
        uint256 stIchi = (stIchiPerShare * amount).divCeil(10 ** lpDecimals);
        uint256 enIchi = (enIchiPerShare * amount) / (10 ** lpDecimals);
        uint256 ichiRewards = enIchi > stIchi ? enIchi - stIchi : 0;
```
stIchi = (220,000 * 350,000).divCeil(10 ** 9)
enIchi = (250,000 * 350,000) / (10 ** 9)

stIchi = 7.7 ≈ 8
enIchi = 8.75 ≈ 8
ichiRewards  = 0

This is a simple example of how this will affect users rewards. From the example above `stIchi` rounds up due to the use of divCeil while `enIchi` rounds down by default.
As seen above this will affect users rewards whenever the calculation results in a floating number. In order to get the right user rewards, the both calculations should either be rounded up or down. 

From the calculation above, the user reward should have been 1, if both calculations were rounded up or down.


## Impact
Due to rounding issues in `pendingRewards`, users may receive lower rewards than they deserve

## Recommendation


To prevent users from receiving lower rewards than they deserve due to rounding issues in `pendingRewards()`, we recommend using `divCeil()` in both `stIchi` and `enIchi` calculations. This will ensure that both calculations are rounded up consistently.
