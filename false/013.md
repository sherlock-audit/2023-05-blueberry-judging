# modifier onlyEOAEx() can be avoided by calling from contract during construction

## Summary

modifier onlyEOAEx() can be avoided by calling from contract during construction

## Vulnerability Detail

BlueBerryBank contract has the modifier onlyEOAEx which is using OpenZeppelin isContract check to ensure that msg.sender is a EOA. This check uses EXTCODESIZE opcode and can be avoided. This check is used only in execute() function which is able to perform any actions with any spells.

## Impact

As I can see, this check was used to allow only EOAs create positions. As this can be avoided, this vulnerability may be critical because exposes protocol to different types of reentrancy attacks

Change check to requite(tx.origin == msg.sender)
