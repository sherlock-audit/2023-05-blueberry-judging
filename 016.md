# If the Balancer pool is paused, the user will not be able to repay their debt

## Summary
If the Balancer pool is paused, the user will not be able to call the `AuraSpell.closePositionFarm()` function to repay their debt, resulting in the user losing their funds
## Vulnerability Detail
The `AuraSpell.closePositionFarm()` function is designed to safely and efficiently close a leveraged position. Inside the function, it calls the `Vault.exitPool()` function to remove a liquidity position.
```solidity
 wAuraPools.getVault(lpToken).exitPool(
                IBalancerPool(lpToken).getPoolId(),
                address(this),
                address(this),
                IBalancerVault.ExitPoolRequest(tokens, minAmountsOut, "", false)
            );
```
As the code below,in the Balancer Vault function, the Vault protocol will call the `onExitPool()` function. If the user is not performing a recovery mode exit, the protocol will check if the pool is currently paused, if the pool is paused, the function will revert and the user will not be able to exit the pool. In this case, calling the AuraSpell.closePositionFarm() function reverts. When user's position is about to be liquidated,user may be unable to repay his debt, resulting in the user losing their funds
```solidity
function onExitPool(
        bytes32 poolId,
        address sender,
        address,
        uint256[] memory balances,
        uint256,
        uint256,
        bytes memory userData
    ) external override onlyVault(poolId) returns (uint256[] memory amountsOut, uint256[] memory dueProtocolFees) {
        uint256 bptAmountIn;

        // When a user calls `exitPool`, this is the first point of entry from the Vault.
        // We first check whether this is a Recovery Mode exit - if so, we proceed using this special lightweight exit
        // mechanism which avoids computing any complex values, interacting with external contracts, etc., and generally
        // should always work, even if the Pool's mathematics or a dependency break down.
        if (userData.isRecoveryModeExitKind()) {
            // This exit kind is only available in Recovery Mode.
            _ensureInRecoveryMode();

            // Note that we don't upscale balances nor downscale amountsOut - we don't care about scaling factors during
            // a recovery mode exit.
            (bptAmountIn, amountsOut) = _doRecoveryModeExit(balances, totalSupply(), userData);
        } else {
            // Note that we only call this if we're not in a recovery mode exit.
            _ensureNotPaused();

            (bptAmountIn, amountsOut) = _onExitPool(sender, balances, userData);
        }

        // Note we no longer use `balances` after calling `_onExitPool`, which may mutate it.

        _burnPoolTokens(sender, bptAmountIn);

        // This Pool ignores the `dueProtocolFees` return value, so we simply return a zeroed-out array.
        dueProtocolFees = new uint256[](amountsOut.length);
    }

```
## Impact
If the Balancer pool is paused,user will be unable to repay his debt, resulting in his assets being liquidated.
