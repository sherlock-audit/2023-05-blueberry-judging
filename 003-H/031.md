# ShortLongSpell#openPosition uses the wrong balanceOf when determining how much collateral to put

## Summary

The _doPutCollateral subcall in ShortLongSpell#openPosition uses the balance of the uToken rather than the vault resulting in the vault tokens being left in the contract which will be stolen.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/spell/ShortLongSpell.sol#L144-L150

        address vault = strategies[param.strategyId].vault;
        _doPutCollateral(
            vault,
            IERC20Upgradeable(ISoftVault(vault).uToken()).balanceOf(
                address(this)
            )
        );

When putting the collateral the contract is putting vault but it uses the balance of the uToken instead of the balance of the vault.

## Impact

Vault tokens will be left in contract and stolen
