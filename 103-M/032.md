# Updating the feeManger on config will cause desync between bank and vaults

## Summary

When the bank is initialized it caches the current config.feeManager. This is problematic since feeManger can be updated in config. Since it is precached the address in bank will not be updated leading to a desync between contracts the always pull the freshest value for feeManger and bank.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/BlueBerryBank.sol#L142

        feeManager = config_.feeManager();

Above we see that feeManger is cached during initialization.

 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-blueberry/blob/main/blueberry-core/contracts/vault/HardVault.sol#L140-L143

        withdrawAmount = config.feeManager().doCutVaultWithdrawFee(
            address(uToken),
            shareAmount
        );

This is in direct conflict with other contracts the always use the freshest value. This is problematic for a few reasons. The desync will lead to inconsistent fees across the ecosystem either charging users too many fees or not enough.

## Impact

After update users will experience inconsistent fees across the ecosystem

Manual Review

## Recommendation

BlueBerryBank should always use config.feeManger instead of caching it.
