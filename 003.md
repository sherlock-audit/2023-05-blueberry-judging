# Incorrect handling of token transfers in BasicSpell.sol

## Summary

A vulnerability exists in the BasicSpell.sol contract, in which an incorrect handling of token transfers could lead to loss of funds for users.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_doRefund` function in BasicSpell.sol is responsible for transferring the remaining balance of a token to the current bank executor. However, it does not check whether the transfer was successful or not. This can lead to a scenario where the transfer silently fails, and the user loses their tokens.

## Impact

This vulnerability can cause users to lose funds when interacting with the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this issue, it is recommended to check the return value of the `safeTransfer` function to ensure the transfer was successful.

```solidity
function _doRefund(address token) internal {
    uint256 balance = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balance > 0) {
        require(
            IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(bank.EXECUTOR(), balance),
            "Transfer failed"
        );
    }
}
```

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy BasicSpell.sol contract
2. Interact with the contract and trigger a refund
3. Observe that the transfer might fail silently, causing the user to lose their tokens.
