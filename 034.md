# AggregatorOracle#getPrice makes a critical change to how deviation is calculated

## Summary

In the original implementation of the AggregatorOracle#getPrice the deviation was calculated as the deviation of the higher price from the lower price. After this most recent change the deviation is now calculated as the deviation of the lower price from the higher price. This can have serious implications on the validity of pricing between models.

## Vulnerability Detail

            bool midMinOk = (prices[1] * 1e18) / prices[0] <= maxPriceDeviation;
            bool maxMidOk = (prices[2] * 1e18) / prices[1] <= maxPriceDeviation;

In the original AggregatorOracle#getPrice the deviation was calculated using the higher price (prices are sorted ascending) as the numerator and the lower as the denominator.

    function _isValidPrices(
        uint256 price0,
        uint256 price1,
        uint256 maxPriceDeviation
    ) internal pure returns (bool) {
        uint256 maxPrice = price0 > price1 ? price0 : price1;
        uint256 minPrice = price0 > price1 ? price1 : price0;
        return
            (((maxPrice - minPrice) * Constants.DENOMINATOR) / maxPrice) <=
            maxPriceDeviation;
    }

In the new implementation uses the higher as the denominator. This is a key change that can have a dramatic effect on the perceived deviation. As an example, we can take the values 20 and 16:

20 - 16 / 16 = 25%
20 - 16 / 20 = 20%

We can see that the perceived deviation is much different between the two

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revert to the previous method of calculating deviation because it is the more sensitive method
