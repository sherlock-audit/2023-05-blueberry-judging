# UniswapV2Oracle.sol can be manipulated through potential flashloan attack

## Summary
UniswapV2Oracle.sol is potentially subject to flashloan manipulation. 
Hypothetical scenario
Attacker flashloans token -> directly transfers tokens to uniswap v2 pool and calls sync(), forcing reserves to match new balances and throwing off calculation of price from getReserves(). attacker then calls some function within blueberry that uses Univ2Oracle, and benefits from inflated value of lp token. Attacker is able to regain some of  original flashloan funds by arbitraging away price difference in Univ2 pool w/ other pools containing the same tokens. Attack is profitable as long as benefit from blueberry outweighs cost of unretrievable tokens. 

## Impact
The value calculated of a UniV2 LP Token can be manipulated by a flashloan, inflating the LP value calculated by UniswapV2Oracle.sol. 

## Vulnerability Detail
UniswapV2Oracle.sol is subject to price manipulation through flashloans, potentially leading to loss of user/protocol funds through inflated position values.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use TWAP to determine the prices of the underlying assets in the pool.
price0CumulativeLast, price1CumulativeLast.
