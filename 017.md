# 1-sided withdrawal from CurvePool is subject to MEV due to lack of slippage checks

## Summary
1-sided withdrawal from CurvePool is subject to frontrunning due to lack of slippage checks

## Vulnerability Detail

1-sided withdrawal from CurvePool is subject to frontrunning due to lack of slippage checks and a minOutPut of 0

```solidity
            ICurvePool(pool).remove_liquidity_one_coin(
                amountPosRemove,
                int128(tokenIndex),
                0 <<@audit minOutPut
            );
```

[Curve Documentation](https://curve.readthedocs.io/factory-pools.html#StableSwap.remove_liquidity_one_coin)

```md
StableSwap.remove_liquidity_one_coin(_burn_amount: uint256, i: int128, _min_received: uint256, _receiver: address = msg.sender)â†’ uint256: nonpayable
```

1. Curve pool has a deposit / withdrawal bonus as a way to incentivize LP to deposit needed assets and withdraw excessive assets. Withdrawing an asset in the smaller side would incur slippage. The size of slippage depends on the size of withdrawal relative to the size of the pool, plus the amplifier. (A-factor)

2.  Therefore even removing liquidity enforces a `_min_received`. Malicious traders can mamipulate the pool to cause massive slippage on the tx, when the protocol puts a `_min_received` to 0.

3. Let's say the protocol is to remove 1m A from a pool of stA / A, where stA and A are two tokens of a stableswap. There is 10m (5m each) on the pool)

4. malicious trader can frontrun the tx, by first depositing 50m on stA, tilting the pool 55m/5m (ratio of 91% to 9%). Now as the protocol is withdrawing the needed asset (9%), it would need to take a massive hair cut.

5. Malicious trader can now backrun the tx by withdrawing the 50m of stA; since the pool is further tilted after the withdrawal of 1m A, the malicious traders receive an withdrawal bonus that can compensate his initial deposit slippage, plus trading fee.

## Impact
max principle loss in case of max MEV.

Apply some slippage checks against price from an external oracle
